File Structure

bash

â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html           # Main HTML file for the application
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css            # CSS for the design and layout

Example Code Snippet

The core password generation logic can be found in script.js:

javascript

generateBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
  const length = lengthEl.value;
  let characters = "";
  let password = "";

  if (lowercaseEl.checked) {
    characters += lowercaseLetters;
  }

  if (uppercaseEl.checked) {
    characters += uppercaseLetters;
  }

  if (numberEl.checked) {
    characters += numbers;
  }

  if (symbolEl.checked) {
    characters += symbols;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    password += characters.charAt(
      Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length)
    );
  }

  passwordEl.value = password;
});

Future Improvements

    Add the ability to copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click.
    Provide password strength indicators (weak, medium, strong) based on the selected options.
    Include an option to avoid ambiguous characters (like 0, O, 1, and l).
